                   <article>
                   <h4>How Halloween Was Born</h4>
                   <p>Halloween (short for "All Hallows' Evening") is a traditional festival 
                    celebrated on October 31 every year, the evening before All Saints Day in 
                    Western Christianity. This is the beginning of the Allhallowtide â€“ the time 
                    in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints, 
                    martyrs and all the faithful departed faithful. The traditional focus of 
                    Halloween revolves around the theme of using "humor and ridicule to confront
                     the powers of death".

                    <br>
                    The popular view holds that many traditions of Halloween stem from Celtic harvest
                    festivals that may have pagan origins, especially the Gaelic festival of Samhain,
                    and that this festival was adopted by the Church. early Christianization. However, 
                    some academics suggest that Halloween developed independently of Samhain and has only 
                    Christian roots.</p>

                    <h4>Source Of Halloween</h4>
                    <p>Halloween is a festival that originated in Western countries. The word "Halloween" 
                    originates from the Christian church, which is a remnant of the festival of All 
                    Hallow Eve (holy feast). November 1st is the day when Christians show their sincerity 
                    before God.
                    <br>
                    However, in Celtic times, the harvest ended on October 31st, the Halloween festival called 
                    Samhain (sowing) which was November 1st. Because according to them: at this time the god of 
                    spring and summer no longer reigns and gives way to Death. When the spirits of the dead return 
                    to their loved ones' homes to ask for food and water, the corpses roam freely. 
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    According to the ancients, on Samhain, the soul of the person who died in the previous 
                    year will find another body to start a new life in the next year. However, the living do not
                    want the spirits of the dead to enter them, so on October 31 the villagers put out the fire in
                    their houses to make the house cold and dull. The humans then disguised themselves as vampires
                    or other monstrous forms to ward off body-seeking ghosts.</p>
